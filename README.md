## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript code for Sol's Pizza website enhances user interaction and functionality. Here's an overview of the key features:

## Event Listeners

Event listeners are set up to respond to user actions:

-- Order Button Click: The orderBtn element, representing the order button, has an event listener attached to it. When clicked, it triggers the redirectToPage function.

-- Mobile Menu Icon Click: The mobileMenuIcon element, representing the mobile menu icon, has an event listener attached to it. When clicked, it triggers the toggleMobileNav function.

## Redirect to Order Page

The redirectToPage function is responsible for redirecting the user to the order page (order.html). This is achieved by updating the window.location.href to the specified URL.

## Toggle Mobile Navigation

The toggleMobileNav function toggles the visibility of the mobile navigation menu. It targets the element with the ID mobileNav and adds or removes the CSS class active. This class likely contains styles that control the visibility or appearance of the mobile navigation menu.

## DOMContentLoaded Event

The DOMContentLoaded event listener ensures that the JavaScript code is executed only when the HTML document has been fully loaded. This is a best practice to prevent issues related to trying to manipulate elements that haven't been rendered yet.

These JavaScript functionalities, combined with the HTML structure and CSS styles, contribute to a seamless and interactive user experience on Sol's Pizza website.
